here lies code for test purposes compiled for convenience and education purposes into personal file trees 

Because a larger part of the group have limited experience with git repositories it seems suited to let these group members have a free playing field, 
it serves both as a convenience to new users and existing due to the ability to ignore each others file trees. 

incidentally this structure also serves as a convenient file sharing platform during the project period.
